# Deep_Learning 

Labs of the course *Deep Learning I*, taught at *Telecom ParisTech* by Geoffroy Peeters and Alasdair Newton, in the context of the Master 2 Data Science, delivered by Ecole Polytechnique.

- Lab 1 : 
  - First TP on how to implement a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) in Python, for a classification problem
  - Second MLP this time with pytorch, for a binary classification problem
  
- Lab 2 :
  - How to implement two different networks in Keras (using Sequential and Functionnal API) and to perform automatic rating of a movie given the text of its review. It uses the imdb (internet movie database) dataset.
  - Train a network to learn the language of the music and then use it to generate new sequences of J. S. Bach's "Cello suite"
  
- Lab 3 :
  - Implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to do image recognition using the CIFAR-10 dataset
  - Goal is to visualise what networks are learning : the Deep Dream algorithm and Adversarial examples. For this, we shall use a pretrained network : VGG16
